# Junos_monitoring_Healthbot
This Repository is for how to debug issues when Junos devices are connected to healthbot

I recommend to go and check khelil github repository for extensive configuration and handling healthbot using cli, GUI, curl, pythonic way. He has already added clean github wikis which explains and get you started with healthbot. In this repository, I am focussing only on configuring and debugging based on specific healthbot features.
